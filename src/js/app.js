The routes. This section says:
  - If the route starts with /, load the App component
  - If the route IS /, load the Home component INSIDE App as this.props.children
  - If the route is /about, load the About component INSIDE App as this.props.children
  - If the route is /team, load the Team component INSIDE App as this.props.children
  - If the route is /about, load the About component INSIDE App as this.props.children
  - If the route is anything else, load the NotFound component INSIDE App as this.props.children

The whole process lets us create **complex, nested user interfaces** with minimal effort,
by simply nesting `Route` components.
